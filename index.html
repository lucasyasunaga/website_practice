		<h1>百笙 Centikhene - electronic mouth organ</h1>

		<a href="sample.html" title="centikhene3"><img src="images/centikhene1.JPG" style="width:100%" ></a>


		<h3>百笙 (hyakushō) - Centikhene is an electronic mouth organ that is modeled after the Laotian traditional mouth organ, Khene, and the Japanese traditional mouth organ, 笙 Shō. </h3>

		<marquee>
           Centikhene’s circuit design is born out of one of the electronic bugs from the project <a href="http://electronicentomology.com"> Electronic Entomology</a>. Centikhene is an attempt to create an electronic folk instrument that is a companion for our daily life. The goal is to have a simple enough design in its interface and architecture, the spirit of folk instrument which lends itself to be iterated, modified and be played by many users.

          Centikhene possesses a breath synchronization instrument (breath sensor) that are developed and adopted from  <a href="http://ijfritz.byethost4.com/Stealth/st_over.htm">Ian Fritz's design of wind sensor</a> to be bidirectional.

           This triggers notes with the movement of the diaphragm both at inhale and exhale, allowing the player to play rhythmically and continuously. This ongoing project started with the help of <a href="https://lorre-mill.com/"> Will Schorre</a> and has gone through a few iterations of prototyping. The next generation is currently been designed with a consideration of bringing the full potential of this format. There will be performances in the near future.
